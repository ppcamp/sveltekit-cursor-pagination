# sveltekit-cursor-pagination

A simple example of how to control and handle with a cursor pagination. This repo uses Tailwind, Sveltekit + TS and Skeleton

In this repo, I'll create a simple pagination component table that can be used by multiple skip/take
approaches, different from tanstack, wich doesn't support well custom features.
